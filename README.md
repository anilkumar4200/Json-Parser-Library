# Json-Parser-Library
A simple and Basic library to understand the design of a JSON parser.


This project explains how to design your own JSON parser. It serves as a basic introduction, providing a structure to help you get started. Note that it does not support recursive objects; to enable this functionality, you'll need to modify the function calls and adjust the map structure.

The parser works with simple JSON files. An example file is provided as ani.json
